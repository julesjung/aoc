# Advent of Code 2025 in Rust

This is a solution to the 2025 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), written in Rust.

## Usage

```sh
cargo run -- --day 1 --input inputs/day1.txt
```

You need to provide your own input files. It is recommanded to place them in an `inputs/` folder.

```sh
cargo run -- --day 1 --input examples/day1.txt
```

In the `examples/` folder, you will find small examples given on AoC's website. The expected output can be found there too.
